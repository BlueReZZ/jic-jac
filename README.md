### Open endorsements from the community

A simple, lightweight mechanism for an individual with an ORCID to recommend an object with a DOI. The recommender lends their authority to the endorsement of the object, and the author of the object benefits from the endorsement. Unlike other social media interactions, our proposal is to provide unambiguous authoritative and specific feedback. The project will link with open infrastructure such as Crossref Event Data. Lowers barrier to entry for ECR to interact with content.
